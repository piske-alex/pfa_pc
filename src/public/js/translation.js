      "PriceFitchAsset provides an execution-only service and does not advise on the merits of any particular conversion of Tokens or its tax or legal consequences. As a general matter, Users should be aware of the following prior to utilizing our Content. a. Assumption of Risks of Cryptographic Systems and Currencies. By using the Content and the PriceFitchAsset Network in any way, you acknowledge the inherent risks associated with cryptographic systems and ecosystems; and warrant that you have an understanding of the usage and intricacies of native cryptographic tokens, like BNT, ETH, EOS, smart contract based tokens (for example, such as those that follow the Ethereum Token Standard) and blockchain-based software systems. You understand that blockchain technologies (such as Ethereum and EOS) and associated currencies or tokens are highly volatile due to many factors including but not limited to adoption, speculation, technology and security risks. You also acknowledge that the cost of transacting on such technologies (where applicable) is variable and may increase at any time causing impact to any activities taking place on the relevant blockchain (such as Ethereum). You acknowledge these risks and represent that PriceFitchAsset cannot be held liable for such fluctuations or increased costs. You acknowledge that you are solely responsible for the process of converting BNT or ETH and that PriceFitchAsset does not offer any such service. PriceFitchAsset cannot be held liable for any losses or damages of BNT, ETH or other cryptocurrencies resulting from the use of services of any third-party provider. b. Assumption of Risk of Regulatory Actions in One or More Jurisdictions. The Content as well as the PriceFitchAsset Network and relevant blockchain (such as Ethereum or EOS) could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory action, which could impede or limit the ability of PriceFitchAsset to continue to develop, or which could impede or limit your ability to access or use the Content, the PriceFitchAsset Network or the applicable blockchain. PriceFitchAsset endeavours to comply with all applicable laws, i.e. all legal requests for information, and reserve the right to provide information, including Project Information, to law enforcement personnel and other third parties to answer inquiries, to respond to legal process, to respond to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction and those exercising the court’s authority and to protect PriceFitchAsset Network and its Users. c. Understanding Tokens requires advanced technical knowledge. Tokens are often described in exceedingly technical language that requires a comprehensive understanding of applied cryptography and computer science in order to appreciate inherent risks. Listing of a Token on the Site does not indicate approval or disapproval of the underlying technology regarding any Token, and should not be used as a substitute for your own understanding of the risks specific to each Token. In using the Content, you represent that you have been, are, and will be solely responsible for making your own independent appraisal and investigations into the risks relating to and concerning the Tokens. You represent that you have sufficient knowledge, market sophistication, professional advice and experience to make your own evaluation of the merits and risks of any conversion or any underlying Token. d. You accept the risk of converting Tokens. You understand the conversion of Tokens may use untested code and protocols. You accept the risk of conversion failure or fault. You agree not to hold PriceFitchAsset accountable for any related losses. Neither you nor we, can reverse, change or cancel a conversion of Tokens transaction marked as complete or pending. Conversion of Tokens using the Content is managed and confirmed via the relevant blockchain. You understand that your relevant blockchain (Ethereum, EOS or other) public address will be made publicly visible whenever you use the Content. e. You are responsible for complying with applicable law. You agree that PriceFitchAsset is not responsible for determining whether or which laws may apply to your conversions, including with respect to tax or money transferring regulations.

You agree not to hold PriceFitchAsset accountable for any related losses. g. PriceFitchAsset does not advise on converting risk. If at any point PriceFitchAsset or its representatives do provide converting recommendations, market commentary, or any other information, the act of doing so is incidental to your relationship with us and imposes no obligation of truth or due diligence on behalf of PriceFitchAsset or its representatives. h. Operation of Token Protocol. We do not own or control the underlying software protocols, which govern the operation of the Tokens (other than the BNT) supported on our platform. You acknowledge and agree (i) that the underlying protocols may be subject to sudden changes in operating rules (‘forks’), and that such forks may materially affect the value, function, and even the name of the Tokens you store.

      "PFA普惠資產採用JPMORGAN(摩根大通)及微軟(Mircosoft)開發的最新區塊鏈技術，將提供強大，安全可靠，穩定的一個區塊鏈技術，打造全新概念的環球支付系統。 普惠公鏈團隊參與到JPMORGAN(摩根大通)及微軟(Mircosoft)開發，屬於世界一流的區塊鏈技術團隊。<br/><p/>" +
      "普惠資產團隊及摩根大通在選擇區塊鏈技術上持相同意見：以太坊是技術最高的區塊鏈，但是以太坊速度慢及需要礦工費限制了非常大量的應用﹐往往一個幾千人的應用已經癱瘓了整個公有鏈；且 無法用於細額交易。<br/><p/>" +
      "鏈改後的普惠資產公有鏈是將原有以太坊公鏈上的普惠資產，升級至獨立的一個主網絡上，技術層面稱為硬分叉，升級後在速度和供需方面非常完善，能應付日後高頻交易。<br/><p/>" +
      "普惠公有鏈的高速﹐共享區塊鏈技術 既解決了速度及細額交易的問題﹐而且增加了一些私隱的設定：私人性信息能夠永遠不會向網絡參與者廣播。私人數據經過加密，只與相關方直接共享﹐同時又不會失去可信任的優秀功能。<br/><p/>" +
      "摩根大通Quorum技術其實是一種基於以太坊的分佈式分類賬協議，包含 Go Ethereum 客戶端（也稱為 geth）的 簡約分支，旨在為金融，供應鏈，零售，房地產等行業提供允許的以太坊實施，支持交易和合同隱私。 因此，普惠團隊善用了以太坊開發人員社區所做的工作。 因為底層技術Quorum 的兼用性非常大﹐在未來更可以從算法層面鏈改。我們可以建立在大量已開發的以太坊技術上﹐例如熟悉的Truffle,MetaMask,Remix ,OpenZeppelin ﹐它們都已經可以直接在普惠資產公有鏈上使用，避免了重複開發的資源浪費。"
